# Automatic pipeline for Making your own Image classifier
High paced image classifier, high accuracy accuracy DIY image classifier
# Aim

This Project aims to build an image classifier that is extremely convenient to personalise and to train your own data in 3 simple steps. Accuracy is substaintially high for all regular purposes.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository in your system and follow these steps-
1. Check if the requirements are satisfied.
2. Make 4 new folders named classif1, classif2, test1 and test2. Run the script trainer.py
3. Read the steps carefully which will be displayed in the command prompt.
4. Press 1 and enter and you'll get window pop-up with webcam stream, here you have to show the perfect part and make sure it fills the black boundation box and click pictures by pressing spacebar. 20-30 is a good limit.
5. Press Esc and then your start with imperfect parts and click again 20-30 images.
6. Again press Esc and and click 4-5 pictures of perfect part (For cross validation) and again Esc and 4-5 of imperfect parts.
7. Press Esc and that program will terminate. Now your dataset is ready to be trained.
9. Run the script Neuralclsf.py and enjoy while it trains.
10. Now run Model.py and another window will pop up, Now you can show either the perfect or the imperfect and the software will determine is it perfect or not.
11. Enjoy your results.
